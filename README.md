# Robot-Car-avoiding-obstacles
The autonomous robotic vehicle uses three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, supported by additional subsystems for motion control. Obstacle avoidance is achieved through a control algorithm that continuously processes sensor data and modifies the vehicle’s direction when an obstacle is detected.
